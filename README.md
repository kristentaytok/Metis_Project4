This notebook covers my project on Audience Reviews of Disney Live-Action Remakes. 

The data science techniques used included: Natural Language Processing (topic modeling) and supervised learning (classification). 

The code is divided into 3 parts: Obtaining the data (web scraping from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes), Preprocessing the Data/Exploratory Data Analysis, and Modeling.
